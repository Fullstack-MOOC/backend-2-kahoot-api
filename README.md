# kahoot-api
New assignment for the MOOC :) A slightly more advanced version of the api from the express/mongo intro

Uses CS52 Express starterpack:

* node with babel
* expressjs
* airbnb eslint rules

Procfile set up to run on [heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#deploy-the-app)

4. install mongoose (w/ npm) and put code in server.js (for now)
